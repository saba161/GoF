# Adapter
Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
Imagine that you’re creating a stock market monitoring app. The app downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format.You can’t use the analytics library “as is” because it expects the data in a format that’s incompatible with your app.You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library.You can create an adapter. This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.
